[weak]
Barely a scratch!

That tickled.

Was that the wind or your aim?

I've had bug bites worse than that.

Is your weapon made of foam?

That was adorable.

You missed... emotionally.

I’ve been hit harder by my little sister.

You call that an attack?

A dramatic gasp... for effect.

I’ll let you try that again.

That bounced right off.

My armor’s offended, not me.

Did something touch me?

Was that a warning shot?

I think I blinked and missed it.

You’ll have to do better than that!

Barely worth reacting to.

I’ve had worse from a handshake.

Let me know when the real hit comes.

[mediocre]
That one hurt a bit!

Okay... that stung.

A decent hit, I’ll give you that.

I’ll feel that in the morning.

Not bad – for a warm-up.

Alright, you got my attention.

Oof... solid enough.

A glancing blow, but it counts.

That left a bruise.

You’ll pay for that one.

Could’ve been worse... but wasn’t great.

Not exactly lethal, but annoying.

Hey! That actually hurt.

My ribs are voting to retreat.

You’ve earned a slight frown.

A respectable jab.

That’s going to slow me down.

Just enough to ruin my day.

That’s gonna need a bandage.

I’ll remember that one.

[strong]
That was a solid hit!

My spleen would like a word.

Okay, that hurt!

I think something cracked...

I’m gonna feel that for weeks.

You hit like you mean it.

That shook my soul.

Is my shoulder still attached?

Now we’re fighting!

Impressive... painfully so.

That’s the kind of pain you write poems about.

You dented more than just armor.

I didn’t sign up for that.

I think I saw stars... and a few regrets.

My ancestors felt that one.

I need a minute... or three.

That blow echoed inside me.

And here I thought I was winning.

My lungs just filed a complaint.

I'm officially re-evaluating life choices.

[deadly]
A devastating blow!

That nearly killed me!

I saw the light… and it waved.

Systems failing… please reboot.

How am I still standing?

This might be the end.

Critical damage taken!

My whole body just screamed.

I’m leaking… something important.

I’ll never walk the same again.

That was not survivable. (Yet here I am.)

That blow could’ve ended a dragon.

I think part of me quit.

Medic! Or maybe a priest.

This is how legends die.

You broke something essential.

I need new armor... and bones.

Just bury me here.

I’ve been hit by wagons that were kinder.

If I live, this goes in my tragic backstory.
